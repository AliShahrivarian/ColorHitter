# ColorRain
### The game is incomplete

Simple try on building android game by V-Play Game Engine.

ColorRain is a simple game about concentration. We are in the world that make us to look and do the repeatitive task and after a while we don't think about what we do.
ColorRain main idea is about challenging your eyes, brain and your hand to work with eachother so you can't do thing with your habits.

## Get Publish:
There is just Android(tested on HUAWEI P8Lite <Android 5.0.1> ) and Linux64bit(tested on Ubuntu 16.04) version for now that stored in publish directory.

## Help:
In the game you have keys on bottom with 9 color. Top of keys is a line that act like ground. When game starts rain drops will fall from top of screen. Your duty is to hit the key that has same color as lowest rain drop. You lose if you hit the wrong key or the rain drop hit the ground.
